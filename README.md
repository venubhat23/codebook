# CodeBook  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is configured with Tailwind CSS.  

## Project Overview  

CodeBook is a React-based application that provides a structured codebook interface with product listing functionality. It includes essential features for a modern React app, along with configurations for deployment and testing.  

## Getting Started  

To get started with this project, follow these steps:  

### Prerequisites  

Make sure you have the following installed:  

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)  
- **npm** (>= 6.x) or **yarn**  

### Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venubhat23/codebook.git
   cd codebook
   ```  
2. Install the necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
3. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  
   Your app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  

## Available Scripts  

In the project directory, you can run:  

### `npm start`  

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.  

### `npm test`  

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.  

### `npm run build`  

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.  

### `npm run eject`  

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the default build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and dependencies directly into your project.  

## Deployment  

You can deploy the project using Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.  

**Live Deployment:** [CodeBook on Netlify](https://venucodebook.netlify.app)  

To manually deploy, run:  
```bash
npm run build
```
Then follow the hosting service's instructions for deployment.
